Greetings! I see that you've found my personal website in this corner of the internet. The name's Dante. I'm a bioengineering student at McGill University, though some may say that I am a software type disguised as one.

I love all things engineering, but I’m not just talking about man-made things. This includes what I like to call natural engineering, the design solutions that evolution has come up with for the creatures that roam, swim, wiggle and fly on this planet.

To that end, I write about both kinds of engineering and explore how they can merge to create even more brilliant things. Take a look around my [blog](blog) and my [projects](projects). Do enjoy, and shoot me an email if you have any thoughts or suggestions!
